    "A GIS is a computer-based system to aid in the collection, maintenance, storage, analysis, output, and distribution of spatial data and information (Bolstad 2016). The traditional behemoth in the GIS industry has been [ESRI](http://www.esri.com/) and their flagship product ArcGIS. QGIS has become more popular recently and replicates many of the functions in ArcGIS Desktop. The popularity of web mapping applications and geotagged device data has also seen the rise in specialized SaaS products ([Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [CARTO](https://carto.com/)) and open source front-end libraries such as [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) and [turf.js](http://turfjs.org/).\n",
